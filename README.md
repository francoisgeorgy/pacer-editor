# Pacer web editor

Configure your Nektar Pacer MIDI controller with your web browser. 


# Requirements

:warning: This application requires a browser that support the [Web MIDI API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/).

Currently, only **Chrome** and **Opera** support this standard. This app will therefore _not_ work in Firefox, Safari, IE or Edge. 


# Limitations

The current version of this editor isn't able to edit the Global configuration of the Pacer.

This editor does not offer patches management either.

This app has mainly be tested with Chrome on a MacBook pro running OS X 10. Some tests have been done with success with Chrome under Linux Mint 17.1. 
The application has never been tested under Windows. Any Windows feedback is very welcome.

Still under active development. Feel free to log bugs/issues. This is a development I'm doing during my freetime. 


# MIDI in your browser

You need to allow your browser to use your MIDI device:
